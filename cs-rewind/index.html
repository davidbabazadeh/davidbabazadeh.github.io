		<h2>Hello</h2>
		<p>In my computer science class this year I've learned and practiced a lot of new things, for example, making a website like this and publishing it on github. Overall Iw learned to program web applicaions using html/css/js canvases (learning those languages on the way) and how to use an arduino both in hardware and software to make things do what you want.</p>
		<p>generally improved my research technique for learning online, writing and debugging code, web apps, arduinos, circutry, and more.</p>
	</div>
<h3 id="codepens">Programs Made on Codepen</h3>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>My First Project</h2>
		<p>        This is the first project I made in this class, I've coded one other project before, but it was only text-based. This class was my first experirience using visual programmming and I had a lot of fun with it. In this project I learned about what the "canvas" is, what its properties are, and how to  play with it in javascript. I also learned about using keyboard input and using animation loops. I've only done object oriented programming once before so this project was a step up, same with algorithms and loops. And finally, I figured out how collision detection works with rectangular figures.</p>
		<p>"R" to start; "wasd" to move; "shift" to sprint; 1234 to change difficulty between games</p>
		<canvas id="dot-collector-1" onclick="dotCollector1()"></canvas>
		<p>~2 weeks: { 35% research; 30% writing code; 35% debugging }</p>
		<p>later on I made a upgraded version...<br>        in this version everything is controlled by the mouse and you can't sprint, I was able to put use my knowledge on trigonometry to make sure there is a max speed for the player to move at all times in any direction.</p>
		<canvas id="dot-collector-2" onclick="dotCollector2()"></canvas>
		<p>~2 + .5 weeks: { 40% research (trig things);  325% adding code; 35% debugging }</p>
		<p>Though these two are the least complicated projects i've worked on, I think they're the most fun, some people I've showed it to actually found it addictive.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Atari Adventure Remake</h2>
		<p>        This project started when I wanted to try using a 2d array (or matrix) to make a map that moves around the play which stands still. When my cs teacher, Mr. Landgreen, saw it, he said it reminded him of atari adventure from when he was a kid and challenged me to try and create it and offered extra credit, it was a challenge for me at the time, in the beginning of the year, but I didn't turn down the challenge and succeeded.<br>        In this project I learned a lot more about creating algorithms, iterating with a loop to move through both dimensions of the map, creating collision for each block, etc. The biggest challenge was making the program flexible for different fields of view (FOV) which you can change w=using the console.</p>
		<p>wasd to move; e to pick up, space to drop; if the dragon catched you, you'll need to refresh the page!</p>

		<h2>"Sky Gunner"</h2>
		<p>I made this project because I wanted to make a simple game where It would be easy to change what pictures are used in html so you can change what's going on.<br>In this project I experimented with accelerations for moving left and right and jumping, though jumping doesn't have a real purpose it was fun playing with it, I also experimented with looping though an array to check seperate arrays for collisions in order to check when bullets or enemies shoud dissappear.</p>
		<p>wasd to move; s to start/restart; l to shoot</p>

		<h2>Solar System</h2>
		<p>In this project I just messed around a little with sequencing arrays and trigonometric waves to make three planets revolve around the sun in 2.5d.</p>

		<h2>"Blocky the Car"</h2>
		<p>This project began while learning to play with libraries, I chose Isomer. I got really deep into Isomer and eventually made a whole game, it was the first project I published to github. <a href="https://summed-up.github.io/blocky-the-car/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h3 id="arduino">Arduino</h3>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>When playing with arduinos I tried attaching a bunch of different devices, LEDs, potentiometer, LED strips, joysticks, pressure sensors, servo motors, stepper motors, remotes, IR sensors, and more. I learned a lot about how to read and use schematics, even applying only similar ones to your situation, which taught me about circitry.</p>
		<p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>First Arduino Project</h2>
		<p>In our first project all we did was attach an led to a potentiometer and the arduino so we could use the knob to change the brightness of our LED. It wasn't much, but it was a first step into learning about the hardware we were creating.</p>
		<img id="arduino-led" class="squared" width="400" height="300" src="https://github.com/summed-up/summed-up.github.io/blob/master/cs-rewind/Cs%20Rewind%20Assets/unnamed.jpg?raw=true" alt="">
		<p>~2 days: { 65% research; 5% writing code; 5% debugging; 25% wiring }</p>
		<p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Joysticks!</h2>
		<p>Experimenting with the joysticks was a lot of fun because it was an interesting source of input. Once we got it working through the software we were easily able to attach it to a servo to control the direction it was pointing. Our first cool project with the joystick was attaching it to an LED strip and controling the position of a line and the color of it.</p>

		<p>Servo - ~3 days: { 65% research; 15% writing code; 2% debugging; 18% wiring }</p>
		<iframe src=https://create.arduino.cc/editor/summedup/02adab20-6859-46d0-b74c-4d92552483bf/preview?embed style="height:320px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>
		<p>LED Strip - ~1.5 weeks: { 60% research; 15% writing code; 5% debugging; 20% wiring/rewiring }</p>
		<p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Stepper Motors!</h2>
		<p>With the stepper motors we did a lot with how it would move using a joystick, then with a remote.</p>
		<p>(code was deleted)</p>
		<p>Joystick - ~4 days: { 50% research; 15% writing code; 15% debugging; 20% wiring }</p>
		<iframe src=https://create.arduino.cc/editor/summedup/02c9b38c-6a6a-4325-8689-959bc47e58d9/preview?embed style="height:320px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>
		<p>Remote - ~2 weeks: { 60% research; 20% writing code; 10% debugging; 10% wiring }</p>
		<p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>High Striker</h2>
		<p>Using arduino, we made a "high striker" project where you hit a pressure pad to make a light shoot up on the LED strip.  learned about pressure pads and their sensitivity, how to detect when it's been hit smoothly.</p>
		<iframe src=https://create.arduino.cc/editor/summedup/92821045-2bd5-432c-8398-db0949ef1c4e/preview?embed style="height:320px;width:100%;margin:10px 0" frameborder=0></iframe>

		<p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Overall</h2>
		<p>Ultimately, we had fun learning to use different devices and combining them to create cool projects. We learned to code in C and use libraries meant for hardware in our code and communicating with the hardware to control what's going on with the code uploaded to the arduino.</p>
		<p></p>

<h3 id="scratch">Scratch</h3>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Robot Exterminator</h2>
		<p>On this project I messed around with "cloning" and different mathematical functions on scratch to create a game that has an increasing number of enemies moving at increaing speeds, but never reaching a point where they're too face and impossible to beat. The rates at which your score goes up and are able to shoot oes the same as well. I polished the game with animations and had fun with the simple form of programming scratch allows.</p>
		<p>(left arm) w and s to move up and down, R to shoot. (right arm) use mouse</p>

		<p></p>
	</div>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Robot Exterminator</h2>
		<p>This was the second project I made on scratch, a mod for the first. I had practice applying acceleration with the fireballs and randomly generating the movement of the enemy.</p>
		<p>space to flap your wings; asd to move left, down, and right respectively</p>
