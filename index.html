		<h2>Hello</h2>
		<p>In my computer science class this year I've learned and practiced a lot of new things, for example, making a website like this and publishing it on github. Overall Iw learned to program web applicaions using html/css/js canvases (learning those languages on the way) and how to use an arduino both in hardware and software to make things do what you want.</p>
	</div>
<h3 id="codepens">Programs Made on Codepen</h3>
	<div class="circled">
		<h2>My First Project</h2>
		<p>        This is the first project I made in this class, I've coded one other project before, but it was only text-based. This class was my first experirience using visual programmming and I had a lot of fun with it. In this project I learned about what the "canvas" is, what its properties are, and how to  play with it in javascript. I also learned about using keyboard input and using animation loops. I've only done object oriented programming once before so this project was a step up, same with algorithms and loops. And finally, I figured out how collision detection works with rectangular figures.</p>
		<p>"R" to start; "wasd" to move; "shift" to sprint; 1234 to change difficulty between games</p>
		<canvas id="dot-collector-1" onclick="dotCollector1()"></canvas>
		<p>later on I made a upgraded version...<br>        in this version everything is controlled by the mouse and you can't sprint, I was able to put use my knowledge on trigonometry to make sure there is a max speed for the player to move at all times in any direction.</p>
		<canvas id="dot-collector-2" onclick="dotCollector2()"></canvas>
		<p>Though these two are the least complicated projects i've worked on, I think they're the most fun, some people I've showed it to actually found it addictive.</p>

		<h2>Atari Adventure Remake</h2>
		<p>        This project started when I wanted to try using a 2d array (or matrix) to make a map that moves around the play which stands still. When my cs teacher, Mr. Landgreen, saw it, he said it reminded him of atari adventure from when he was a kid and challenged me to try and create it and offered extra credit, it was a challenge for me at the time, in the beginning of the year, but I didn't turn down the challenge and succeeded.<br>        In this project I learned a lot more about creating algorithms, iterating with a loop to move through both dimensions of the map, creating collision for each block, etc. The biggest challenge was making the program flexible for different fields of view (FOV) which you can change w=using the console.</p>
		<p>wasd to move; e to pick up, space to drop; if the dragon catched you, you'll need to refresh the page!</p>
		<canvas id="atari-adventure-remake" onclick="atariAdventureRemake()"></canvas>

	<div class="circled">
		<h2>"Sky Gunner"</h2>
		<p>I made this project because I wanted to make a simple game where It would be easy to change what pictures are used in html so you can change what's going on.<br>In this project I experimented with accelerations for moving left and right and jumping, though jumping doesn't have a real purpose it was fun playing with it, I also experimented with looping though an array to check seperate arrays for collisions in order to check when bullets or enemies shoud dissappear.</p>
		<p>wasd to move; s to start/restart; l to shoot</p>
		<canvas id="sky-gunner" onclick="skyGunner()"></canvas>

	<div class="circled">
		<h2>Solar System</h2>
		<p>In this project I just messed around a little with sequencing arrays and trigonometric waves to make three planets revolve around the sun in 2.5d.</p>
		<p></p>
		<canvas id="solar-system" onclick="solarSystem()"></canvas>

	<div class="circled">
		<h2>"Blocky The Car"</h2>
		<p>This project began while learning to play with libraries, I chose Isomer. I got really deep into Isomer and eventually made a whole game, it was the first project I published to github. <a href="https://summed-up.github.io/blocky-the-car/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
